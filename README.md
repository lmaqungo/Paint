# Paint Clone  

Simple paint clone. LMB to draw, RMB to erase. click color options to change color, and clear to clear canvas.           
Warning! I would advise not installing. This game is a memory management disaster. It will likely crash. Will fix within the coming hours    
My other programs are more functional
